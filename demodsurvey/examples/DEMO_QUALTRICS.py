#%% INPUTS & INITIALIZATION

"""
For the time being, we can simplify the problem and consider only the type of 
household and the number of residents as input. The input dictionary is as follows:
    - 'n_residents' : int from 1 to 5
    - 'household_type' : int from 1 to 5
        1 = One person household
        2 = Couple without kid
        3 = Single Parent with at least one kid under 18 and the other under 27
        4 = Couple with at least one kid under 18 and the other under 27
        5 = Others
